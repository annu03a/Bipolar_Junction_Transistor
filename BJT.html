<h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p> The transistor was originated by Dr. William shockley and Dr. John Bardeen at Bell Laboratory in America in 1951. It was firstly used in 1952
in Telephone switching circuits. The transistor is a basic building block of modern electronic systems. It is a three terminal device. It is a Current- 
controlled device. BJT stands for Bipolar Junction Transistor.It employ electrons and holes as charge carrier.It is a Bipolar Transistor.
 A BJT is made up of three on and off layers of P and N type semiconductor and two P-Njunctions. The flow of current is due to majority charge carrier and 
Minority charge carrier. It has a very important propertity that it can raise the strength of an input weak signal which is called Amplification.</p>

<h1>Junction Transistor Construction</h1>
<p>A transistor is a single crystal of silicon (Si) or Germanium (Ge). A transistor can be of two types NPN or PNP
 A transistor consists of two PN junctions. The junctions are formed by sandwitching either P-type or N-type semiconductor
 layers between a pair of opposite types.
A transistor has three regions. They are emitter, base and collector .A brief introduction and functioning of these three junctions
 may be discussed as ahead:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Emitter: It is an outer region situated in oneside of transistor The function of emitter is to inject charge carriers 
(electrons in case of NPN transistor and holes in case of PNP transistors) into the base Since emitter
 has to supply a large number of charge carriers, so it is heavily doped.</li>
<li>Base: It is the middle region of the transistor The base is a very thin and lightly doped region. The function of this region is
 to pass all the charge carriers (electrons or holes) onto the collector.</li>
<li>Collector: It is the other outer region situated in the other side of transistor The doping of collector is between the heavy doping of emitter 
and light doping of Base. The function of collector is collect charge carriers (electrons or holes). The collector region is physically larger than 
the emitter regon. The reason for this is that the collector has to dissipate more heat Hence, it is clear that alhough a BJT has two same type 
of outer regions, their function cannot be interchanged.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Biasing of a transistor</h1>
<p>When dc voltages are applied across the different terminals of a transistor then this pro called biasing. Since, there are two junctions in a 
transistor namely emitter-base junction and collector-base junction, each of these two junctions may be forward-biased or reverse- biased. Therefore, 
there are four possible ways of biasing these two junctions. These possible ways are also called modes of operation of a transistor.</p>
<h1> Working of a transistor</h1>
<p>To explain the working of a transistor we consider an NPN transistor which is biased for active
operation. That means, emitter-base junction is forward-biased by battery Veb and collector-base junction is reverse-biased by battery Vcb.</p>
<p>
The forward-biased voltage is small and reverse-biased voltage Veg is quite large. The forward bias on the emitter- base junction pushes a 
large number of free electrons in the N-type emitter towards the base. This makes the emitter current (Ig). A very few holes also pass from
 the base region to the emitter region. This flow of electrons and holes constitute emitter current (Ig). Since, the electron current is useful
 in the action of transistor, it is made larger and larger than the hole- current by doping the base region more lightly than emitter region. Hence,
 only a very small portion nearly 0.5% of the emitter current is due to the holes passing from the base to the emitter.</p>
<p>The direction of conventional current is always taken opposite to the flow of electrons.After reaching the base region, the electrons tend to combine 
with holes. But since the b very thin and lightly doped, only a very few electrons combine with holes to constitute the current (I). The remaining
 electrons pass on to the collector which is a positively biased N- These electrons are collected by the collector to constitute the collector current.
There is one another component of collector current due to the thermally generated carriers (holes in this case) which pass towards the base. 
This small current component is reverse saturation current.</p>
<h1>Transistor Configuration</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Common-base configuration:</b> In common-base configuration, the base of the transistor is Made common. The input is applied between the emitter and base
 and the output is taken between the collector and base.
</li>

<li><b>Common-emitter configurations:</b> In common-emitter configuration the emitter of the transistor is made common. The input is applied between base and
 emitter and the output a take between collector and emitter. This configuration is most widely used.</li>

<li><b>Common collector configuration:</b> In common colector configuration, the collector is made common. The input is applied between base and collector and
 the output is taken between emitter and collector.</li>
